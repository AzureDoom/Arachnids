v.0.0.3

- Fixes Mending and Unbreaking. Completely rewrote the system for it. 
- Fixed being able to put Flare, Grenade and Sniping Enchaments on anything, now only useable by the mods guns.

- This is just a WIP build, only the Workers/Warriors have actual API and spawn in deserts. All mobs will spawn via structures later on.
